# 📝 Libft

### 🌟 "Your very first own library"

**Libft** is the first project at 42, where we recreate basic functions from the C standard library and implement additional utility functions for string, memory, and data type handling.
This project strengthens essential **C programming skills**, attention to detail, and good coding practices.
