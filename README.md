# 📝 Libft

### 🌟 "Your very first own library"

**Libft** is the first project at 42, where we recreate basic functions from the C standard library and implement additional utility functions for string, memory, and data type handling.
This project strengthens essential **C programming skills**, attention to detail, and good coding practices. 

---

## 🎯 Goal

- Reimplement functions from the C standard library (`<string.h>`, `<ctype.h>`, `<stdlib.h>`). 
- Create utility functions for string, memory, and data type handling. 
- Practice memory management and pointers. 
- Improve organization, documentation, and coding best practices. 

## ⚠️ Disclaimer 

- This project is still in progress and not fully completed. Some functions may be under development.
- Contributions are not welcome! As the project is personal.
